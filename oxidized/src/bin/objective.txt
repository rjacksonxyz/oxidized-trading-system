First, we need to obtain the list of ticker symbols for the instruments we want to analyze.
In this case, that will be the S&P 500 ticker symbols. In Python, this is pretty straight forward:

tickers.py
-----------
import requests
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

res = requests.get("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies")
soup = BeautifulSoup(res.content, "html")
table = soup.find_all('table')[0]
df = pd.read_html(str(table))
print(df)

Implementing in Rust will take a more manual approach, as well as some knowledged of HTML tags
